parfwd WMT2020 MT datasets (parallel feaure weight decay for instance selection)

We make the English, Czech, German, and Russian datasets available that we use when building parfwd Moses SMT models at WMT 2020 (http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/):

The datasets allow fast deployment of accurate MT systems and can be used for benchmarking the performance of MT models. Reference translations for the test set are available from http://www.statmt.org/wmt20/translation-task.html.
